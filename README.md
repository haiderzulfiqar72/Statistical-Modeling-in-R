# Statistical-Modeling-in-R

Lab Exercise 1: Linear Regression in R. Explore data relationships, model fitting, diagnostics, and interpret results.

The code covers various statistical procedures, such as linear regression, hypothesis testing, and predictive hypothesis testing.

Lab Exercise 2: ANOVA, Pairwise Comparisons, & Model Selection. Analyze rat toxicity data using R for hypothesis testing.

The code includes various procedures, such as linear regression, generalized linear models (GLMs) with different link functions, predictive hypothesis testing, and confidence interval estimation. 

Lab Exercise 3: Categorical Data Analysis. Fit GLMs in R, compare models, and interpret results for various distributions.

The code covers two questions, each containing several subparts involving data analysis and statistical modeling. The tasks include linear regression, generalized linear models (GLMs) with different link functions, predictive hypothesis testing, selection of the best-fitted models, and stepwise regression.

Lab Exercise 4: Predictive Modeling & Confidence Intervals. Perform predictive hypothesis testing and interval estimation.

The code involves statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and selecting the best-fitted models for different datasets. The code consists of tasks like Poisson regression, quasi-Poisson regression, binomial regression, calculating confidence intervals, mean squared errors (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and predicting outcomes based on the selected models.

Lab Exercise 5: Ordinal & Nonlinear Regression in R. Explore cumulative and nonlinear models for tire reliability.

The code involves working with statistical models for different datasets. It performs tasks such as fitting multinomial models, cumulative link models, polynomial regression, non-linear least squares (NLS), and predicting outcomes based on the models.

Lab Exercise 6: Survival Analysis & Hazard Functions. Apply Cox and Weibull models for tire survival data in R.

The code involves working with survival models (Cox proportional hazards model and Weibull proportional hazards model) for different datasets. The code performs tasks such as fitting survival models, estimating hazard functions, predicting survival probabilities, and obtaining confidence intervals.
